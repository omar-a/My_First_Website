		<h3>Programming</h3>
		<p>Knows how to code:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>CSS</li>
			<li>html</li>
			<li>JavaScript</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Was a member of Girls Who Code</p>
		<p> At Girls Who Code, I learned how to use JavaScript. It was a great experience, and I look forward to staying in and continuing with the program.</p>
		<p>New Goals For Programming:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>To code with Python</li>
			<li>To code with Ruby</li>
			<li>To code with C++</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="entrepreneurship" class="grid_5">
		<h3>Entrepreneurship</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Co-Founder and Operations Officer at Kids.On</li>
			<li>Student at <a href="http://nycgenerationtech.com/">NYC Generation Tech</a></li>
			<p>Being at GenTech has taught me a lot. It made me realize that if I ever want to be successful at what I do, I can't stay in a classroom. I have to learn from experience. Likewise, instead of teaching us business in a classroom setting, we build an app and a business plan with a team. This is how KidsOn began.</p>

	<div class="education">
		<h3>Education</h3>
		<p>Student at <a href="siths.org">Staten Island Technical High School</a></p>
		<p>Being a student at Staten Island Technical High School is a great thing. There are opportunities left and right, and I learned valuable skills there. At my high school, for example, I learned how to use AutoCAD for Mac.</p>
	</div>
	<div class= "autocad">
		<h3>Other Skills</h3>
		<p>Proficient with AutoCAD for Mac</p>
		<p>The best thing about AutoCAD is that you can make three dimensional drawings. It allows you to draw something as if you were holding it in your hands. Even so, you can also design skyscrapers. Nothing is too big or small to be drawn in AutoCAD.</p>

	<div class= "chess">
		<h3>Other Interests- Mainly Chess</h3>
		<p>Chess is my favorite game, exercise, and hobby all at once. It's enjoyable and it's competitive. It makes me think quite a bit, and trains me to think faster and more efficiently. This is necessary because I have often played in tournaments against the clock more than any opponent. As of yet, I am unrated. I want to stay that way until I get better. Although a larger challenge is exciting, it isn't if I lose every game!</p>
